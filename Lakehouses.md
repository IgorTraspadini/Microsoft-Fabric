# Introduction
Fabric's Lakehouse is built upon the OneLake scalable storage layer and leverages Apache Spark and SQL compute engines for big data processing. A Lakehouse is defined as a unified platform that combines the flexible and scalable storage of a data lake with the ability to query and analyze data similar to a data warehouse.

The scenario presented involves a company that has traditionally used a data warehouse to store structured data from transactional systems. However, challenges arise when dealing with unstructured data from sources like social media, website logs, and third-party platforms, which are challenging to manage and analyze within the existing data warehouse infrastructure. To address this, the company opts for Microsoft Fabric to enhance decision-making capabilities by analyzing data in various formats from multiple sources.

The module explores how the Lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric serves as a solution to such scenarios. It provides a scalable and flexible data store for both files and tables, allowing users to query the data using SQL. This approach enables efficient analysis of diverse data types and sources within a unified platform, offering improved capabilities for decision-making.
